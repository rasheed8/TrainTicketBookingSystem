# TrainTicketBookingSystem
A simple ticket booking system for passengers which gets the price based on the passenger type and their journey length. 

This will probably change a little bit from the inital commit, but it is currently focused on the passengers, price and journey in relation. At some point I will probably take other factors into account and change it around a little. There is also a UML Class Diagram File and a screenshot of the Class Diagram included in this repo for design purposes.
